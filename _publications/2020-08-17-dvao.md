### Abstract
We present a novel deep learning based technique for volumetric ambient occlusion in the context of direct volume rendering.
Our proposed Deep Volumetric Ambient Occlusion (DVAO) approach can predict per-voxel ambient occlusion in volumetric data sets, while
considering global information provided through the transfer function. The proposed neural network only needs to be executed upon
change of this global information, and thus supports real-time volume interaction. Accordingly, we demonstrate DVAOâ€™s ability to predict
volumetric ambient occlusion, such that it can be applied interactively within direct volume rendering. To achieve the best possible
results, we propose and analyze a variety of transfer function representations and injection strategies for deep neural networks. Based
on the obtained results we also give recommendations applicable in similar volume learning scenarios. Lastly, we show that DVAO
generalizes to a variety of modalities, despite being trained on computed tomography data only.
